# Quotobot
A Discord bot that tells quotes!

## How to set up the config.json
Make a copy of config-example.json and call it config.json. Change the prefix if you like (keep it inside the quotes). Where it says *"your-token-here"*, paste in your token (also inside the quotes). If you want the bot to output its invite link, change
```json
"clientID-example": "12345678901234",
```
to
```json
"clientID": "12345678901234",
```
making sure to change the number to your client ID inside the quotes.
## Run the bot
Make sure you have NodeJS installed and open a command prompt/terminal in the folder where these files are. Then run:
```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

# Tentative Timeline
Publish v1.0.1 of the bot: **August 23** (by the latest): **100+ NEW QUOTES! The quotes will be basic text quotes.**

Publish v1.0.2 of the bot: **August 30** (by the latest): **The quotes will be embeds with features such as icons!**

Publish v.1.0.x of the bot: **We will periodically add more quotes and features, including general features unrelated to quotes! There is no deadline as school will restart and time to work on this project will be limited.**
